# Week 1 Toy problems

## Prerequisites

Prerequisites:

1. Create a repository on your GitHub account.

**_ NB: One folder, with 3-4 files for each solution. Please note that a single file should only hold one solution. _**

2. Use JavaScript to wire down the solution.

3. Push the solution to the above repository once done.

4. Submit the repository link for grading.

5. Ensure your repository has a well written README.

NOTE: You are required to complete ALL the challenges.

## System Requirements

- Node 18+
- A browser capable of running JavaScript (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Edge)
- Operating System (Windows 10+, MacOS, Linux, etc.)
- A text editor capable of running JavaScript (Visual Studio Code, Vim, Nano, Emacs, Atom, Sublime Text, etc.)
- RAM >= 4GB
- Disk space >= 1GB

## installation

- On the top right corner of this page there is a button labelled `Fork`.

- Click on that button to create a copy of the repository to your own account.

- Follow the process described in `Alternative One` above.

- Remember to replace your username when cloning.

      git clone https://github.com/jerryambwere/-repeated-challenge.git
      
## Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator (Toy Problem)

Write a function that prompts the user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. The output should correspond the correct grade, as shown below:

        A > 79,
        B - 60 to
        , C -  59 to 49
        , D - 40 to 49
        , E - less 40.

- Open the index.html file in Mozilla Firefox, Safari or any Chromium-based browser.

- If using VS Code, you can use the Live Server extension to run the file on the browser for live reloading.

- Click
  (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to install the Live Server extension and to read instructions on how to use it.
  use the visual studio code terminal to test the programme to ccheck its workability using the command node followed by the
  name of the file
- Inside `grade_calculator.js`, invoke/call each of the functions, one at a time and with varied inputs, to test the different logic implementations and check the output on the console.

## Challenge 2: Speed Detector 
### description
Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

> For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.


### running the programme

- With the `index.html` file still running in your browser (Check Challenge 1 above on how to do it), open the `speed_calculator.js` file.
- Invoke/call the function with different inputs/arguments, to test the different logic implementations and check the output on the console.

- Remember to comment out each function execution once done to avoid confusion with the output

## Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator (Toy Problem)
### description 
Write a program whose major task is to calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the payee (i.e. Tax), NHIF Deductions, NSSF Deductions, gross salary, and net salary.

NB: Use KRA, NHIF, and NSSF values provided in the link below.

### Running the application

- With the `index.html` file still running in your browser (Check Challenge 1 above on how to do it), open the `salary_calculator.js` file.
- Invoke/call the functions, one at a time and with different inputs/arguments, to test the different logic implementations and check the output on the console.

- Remember to comment out each function execution once done to avoid confusion with the outputs
